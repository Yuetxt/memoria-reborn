  "welcomeText": "You wake to the murmur of distant voices and the bustle of a city you don’t recognize. Sunlight spills between tall buildings, and the air carries scents of spice and bread. As you sit up on hot cobblestones, your head throbs, fragments of memory flicker back.  \n\nYour name… [discord nickname]. That much is clear. But who you were, and how you got here? A blur.  \n\nThen, a faint glow catches your eye. A small crystal, softly pulsing beneath your skin, rests in your palm. It feels alive  and strangely familiar.  \n\nDrawn by instinct, you step out of the alley and into a vast, vibrant city where humans and fantastic creatures coexist. Magic hums in the air, mixing with laughter, trade, and song.  \n\nThis is Babylon, the city of legends. At its center rises the Tower of Babel, a relic of rebellion against the gods. They say it holds the imprisoned spirits of the ancients and the secrets of creation.  \n\nYour gaze locks on its peak, and an unseen force stirs within you. You’re no hero, no chosen one yet something compels you to climb. Perhaps, within that tower, you’ll uncover the truth about this world… and yourself.  \n\nYour journey begins now. \n"
